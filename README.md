# Natural Language-Guided Robotic Assistant for Task Automation

This project builds a robotic assistant capable of interpreting natural language instructions and performing real-world tasks by combining NLP, reinforcement learning, and robotic control systems.

## Features
- Natural language parsing and grounding with GPT-based models.
- Reinforcement learning policies (e.g., PPO, SAC) for dynamic task execution.
- Integration with ROS for real-world robotic control.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Natural-Language-Guided-Robotics.git
cd Natural-Language-Guided-Robotics
pip install -r requirements.txt
